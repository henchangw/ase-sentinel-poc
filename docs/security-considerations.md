# Security considerations

This POC changes a WAF policy when `autoBlockEnabled` is true. That is the default in Bicep and in `scripts/deploy.ps1`. Pass `-AutoBlockEnabled $false` to deploy a dry-run. `-ConfirmAutoBlock` is accepted and is not required. The Function App setting is the JSON token `true` or `false`. The strings `True` and `False` are rejected.

## Identity

The playbook and the Function App each use a system-assigned managed identity. The Sentinel API connection is `ManagedServiceIdentity` with `parameterValueType` Alternative. There is no user OAuth token in source.

The playbook identity can read incident entities and write a comment when the function call does not finish. It does not have Network Contributor. The function identity can comment on incidents in the POC resource group (Sentinel Responder) and can write the single WAF policy (Network Contributor). Neither identity is a subscription Owner or a contributor on the resource group.

Network Contributor is broader than updating one custom rule. A holder of the function identity can change other properties of that policy, including managed rules, if the code is changed later. The function PUTs `policySettings`, `customRules`, and `managedRules` echoed from the GET, plus the block rule. It does not grant itself more roles.

The function key is a Logic App secure parameter. `deploy.ps1` does not print it. The binding deployment stores it. The function runtime uses its system-assigned identity for host storage. Flex package upload still uses the storage account key. That key is not written to the repository.

The Azure Security Insights service principal is granted Microsoft Sentinel Automation Contributor on the POC resource group so an automation rule can start the playbook. That is the role Microsoft requires for `RunPlaybook`. It is not granted on other resource groups by this template.

## What cannot be blocked by default

The analytics rule and the playbook both refuse, unless `overrideProtectedRanges` is explicitly set:

- `0.0.0.0/8`
- RFC1918: `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`
- Loopback `127.0.0.0/8`
- Link-local `169.254.0.0/16`, which includes the instance metadata address `169.254.169.254`
- `100.64.0.0/10`
- IPv6 unspecified `::/128`, loopback `::1/128`, link-local `fe80::/10`, and unique local `fc00::/7`

The rule also applies watchlist `AseWafIpAllowlist`. The function applies `protectedIpRanges` from its app settings and does not read that watchlist. Built-in ranges are hard-coded in the KQL and in the function, so a watchlist edit cannot remove them.

`overrideProtectedRanges` skips those filters in both places. The deploy script will not set it without `-ConfirmOverrideProtectedRanges`. Empty values, non-canonical addresses, and IPv4-mapped IPv6 are still rejected. Application Gateway still does not write IPv6 into `IPMatch`.

Customer ranges the function cannot parse fail the run before any block decision, including the dry-run sentence. The deploy script rejects those ranges first. The function check remains so a later app-setting edit cannot silently ignore a prefix such as `/12`.

## Dry-run and opt-in

The function sends a PUT only when `autoBlockEnabled` is the JSON boolean `true`. The string `"true"` stays a dry-run. Dry-run still GETs the policy so it can avoid saying "Would block" for an address that is already listed. GET does not modify the policy. An incident that contains only IPv6 on Application Gateway does not GET, because that provider cannot block an IPv6 source.

Duplicates are removed with `union` before a write. A second incident for an address already on the rule does not PUT. If the merged list would exceed `maximumBlockEntries`, nothing is written.

The automation rule does not contain an approval action. With the default `autoBlockEnabled` of true, the next matching incident is written without an analyst click. Pass `-AutoBlockEnabled $false` to stop those writes. That product choice is still open for ASE. The README question list leaves it open.

## Evidence

Each terminal path comments on the incident: incident number, title, decision, rejected addresses, policy id, and the Logic App run name. Alert custom details carry the request, rule, action, and timestamps from the WAF row. Playbook runtime logs go to the same workspace.

The WAF rule itself does not store a reason. If the incident is closed and deleted, or the resource group is deleted, that comment is gone. Export it before cleanup when the record has to be kept. Workspace retention defaults to 30 days.

A failed PUT tells the operator not to assume the address was blocked. The PUT is not retried, because a timeout after a successful write must not be followed by a second write from the same action. The operator reads the policy before resubmitting.

## Integrity of the policy write

The PUT replaces the custom-rule collection with "every existing rule except the block rule, plus the new block rule". A bug in provider selection could send the wrong JSON shape. The intended result is an ARM validation error and the failure comment. Do not point `wafProvider` at a policy of the other type to find out. The deploy script checks the resource-id type when a full id is supplied.

There is no `If-Match` etag. Two writers can lose an update. This matters if an operator edits the same policy while a playbook run is in flight.

The block rule uses action Block. On Application Gateway that action is enforced in Prevention mode. In Detection mode Microsoft documents that the custom rule is logged and not enforced. Opting in while the policy is in Detection mode can still write the IP onto the rule. It should not be described as blocking traffic until the policy mode enforces it.

## Test rig exposure

The test gateway has a public IPv4 address and an HTTP listener. The backend is not a real application. The listener is still on the internet and the gateway is billed. Delete the resource group when the test is finished.

No customer data and no production WAF is required to run the default path. Attaching the playbook to an existing policy is a separate, explicit parameter set and should be a disposable policy until ASE names the real target.

## Secrets

Source, parameter files, and scripts do not contain keys, passwords, or connection strings. `.gitignore` excludes local ARM build output. Do not add a service principal secret to make the deploy script non-interactive. Use the Azure CLI login you already have.
